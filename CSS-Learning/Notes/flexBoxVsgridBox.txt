//Flexbox -> single-dimension layout model(either row or column)
//GridBox -> Two-dimension layour model(both row and column)

/** Flexbox Froggy **/
-> justify-content -> Aligns along the Main Axis (X-axis)
-> align-items(Direction) -> Aligns along the Cross Axis (Y-axis)
-> align-self (only for the child) -> Overrides align-items for that specific child only
-> flex-wrap -> Aligns/Wraps child either single line or with additional line
-> flex-flow -> Combition of flex-direction and flex-wrap
